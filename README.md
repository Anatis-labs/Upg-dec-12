# Upg-dec-12
The game is "Hangman"
1 player enters a word (default word is test).

Then the others enter a letter and it comes up as right or wrong, if its wrong then player lose a hp.

I chose the memento pattern since it seemed to suit my game the most.
I used the memento pattern with 2 stacks, 1 for undo and 1 for redo.

So if u undo something it gets saved into the redo stack instead so you can redo the option that you have undon (in case it was a misstake to undo or if you simply changed your mind).
